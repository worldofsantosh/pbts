Create a class, RouteNetwork, and add a main method that makes a graph to represent the network of airports shown in the image above.

a. Each airport is a vertex. The airport code is a string, e.g. "ROC".

b. The weight of each edge is an amount in tens of dollars, e.g. 15 = $150.

3. Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm as described in class. Modify the main method in your RouteNetwork class to:

a. Prompt the user to enter two airport codes, e.g. DCA and ORD

b. Print the lowest cost path between the two airports as determined by Dijkstra’s Algorithm, e.g. "DCA ROC ORD, 250 dollars."
